# testimonies-and-pictures
**Intro:** 
This work is not a complete project. This is just a little stylized markup for a huge collection of reports from an Excel spreadsheet that was extremely unreadable. So this markup made it more readable. *The original site is not mine. So this is just helping a friend.

**About:** 
So there is a huge collection of data. Each element of data includes text that can be of different lengths and set of pictures or video(max five). *There is Excel Database with links to Google Drive files for pictures for the original site.
 
 **Task:** 
 Make adaptive website, with clickable little images that open fullscreen without download it. 
 
 **Features:**
- view files uploaded to Google Drive without download it (used additional settings for URL). (it was the most difficult task)
- adaptive layout(includes print media query)
- the float css propery for box with images
